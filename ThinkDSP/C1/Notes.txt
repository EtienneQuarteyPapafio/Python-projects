The lowest frequency component of as signal is called the fundamental frequency.

The largest amplitude frequency is called the dominant frequency.

The perceived pitch of a sound is determined by the fundamental even if its not the dominant.

Other spikes in the spectrum that are integer multiples of the fundamental are called harmonics as they harmonious with the fundamental.
